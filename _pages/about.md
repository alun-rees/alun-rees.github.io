I am a second year PhD student at the University of Warwick, working on implementing synthetic diagnostics for the Radiation-Hydrodynamics code, Odin. My work is predominantly focused on diagnostics that are relevant to the Shock Ignition branch of Direct-drive Inertial Confinement Fusion. 

My supervisors are [Professor Tony Arber](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/cfsa/people/tda/ "Profile") and [Dr Keith Bennett](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/cfsa/people/bennett "Profile").

In addition to my work with synthetic diagnostics, I have also been working on testing the Bremsstrahlung routine recently implemented in the EPOCH Particle-In-Cell code. The module works by implementing a Monte-Carlo routine that reads in values from the Seltzer and Berger tables that give the cross sectional areas of generating Bremsstrahlung photons, for a large range of electron energies.
