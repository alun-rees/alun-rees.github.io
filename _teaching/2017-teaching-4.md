As part of being a Physics PhD student at Warwick University, we are asked to help with the teaching of some of the first year modules. The module I was assigned to help out with was 'Mathematics for Physicists'. As part of my role, then I lead two problems classes a week, with about 8 students in each, and go through the fundamental mathematics needed to progress through a Physics degree. Topics include complex numbers, calculus, linear algebra, matrices, and fourier series.
