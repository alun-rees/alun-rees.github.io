Having finished my Masters course at the University of York, I returned to Cardiff. When I returned, I worked as a private tutor through the online company Tutora (now called Tutorful). During the year that I tutored, then I taught a variety of subjects: Physics, Maths, GCSE Science, IT, and Welsh, to a range of ages from Year 7 to Year 13. The only reason I finished tutoring was because I started my PhD at Warwick.
