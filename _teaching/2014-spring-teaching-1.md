During my time at Durham University, I undertook a module called Physics into Schools. As part of this module, we spent 2 terms as a teaching assistant in a local school. The school I was assigned to was Hurworth school in Darlington. During my time at the school then I helped out with GCSE science classes, and lead a couple of classes. For this module I achieved a distinction.
