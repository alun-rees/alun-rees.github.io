Over the summer holidays between my 1st and 2nd year at Durham, I applied for the Ogden Trust teaching internship for which I was succesful. I was assigned to work at the Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys on the outskirts of Canterbury. I worked under the tutelage of Dr Becky Parker, an esteemed academic and educator, who has since gone on to be awarded an MBE. During my time at the school, I helped out with Mathematics and Physics classes and also helped out with the school's touch rugby initiative which was coordinated by ex-Fijian internation rugby player, Nicky Little.
