Hydrodynamic simulation codes play an important role in the study of Plasma physics, particularly in the fields of Inertial Confinement Fusion and Astrophysics. They can be used to design experiments and to predict the behaviour of astrophysical bodies that are hard to observe. The fundamental principle of Hydrodynamic codes is to solve the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the time evolution of fluid parameters as a set of first order differential equations.
