The bremsstrahlung x-ray emission profile from high intensity laser-solid interactions pro-vides valuable insight to the internal fast electron transport.  These high energy electronscan  be  problematic,  and  can  preheat  the  core  of  the  fuel  capsule  thus  making  ignitionmore  difficult.   Measurements  of  the  hot-electron  temperature  and  the  associated  hot-electron fraction supports the understanding of energy absorption mechanisms present inthe 1019-1021W cmâˆ’2intensity regime.  In this paper we discuss the various diagnosticsbeing utilised in order to gain further insight into these electrons
